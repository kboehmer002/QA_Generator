Bacteria are members of a unique taxonomic kingdom consisting of prokaryotic unicellular organisms. Prokaryote is a term from ancient Greek meaning “before the kernel.” The kernel in this case is a nucleus, which prokaryotes lack. Prokaryotes also do not have any membrane-bound organelles. In fact, many of the organelles found in eukaryotes—like an endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and peroxisomes—are completely absent in prokaryotes.
